We apply CountClust Grade of Membership (GoM) model for clustering the single cell data from lymph 
node (LN) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of three HIV- and one HIV+ patients.

An example of countclust fit on single cell data from one patient (TFH146) on just the Live cells.

[Example application of CountClust](ex_countclust.html)

[CountClust on TFH041 scRNA-seq data](tfh041Explore.html)

[CountClust on TFH095 scRNA-seq data](tfh095Explore.html)

[CountClust on MP046 scRNA-seq data](mp046Explore.html)

Separate Grade of Membership model fit and subsequent gene annotations and gene set enrichment
analysis of the clusters, for the different patients

First, we perform this analysis for TFH146

[CountClust application separately on LN and PBMC Live cells for TFH146](separate_countclust_LN_PBMC_Live_TFH146.Rmd)

[CountClust application separately on LN and PBMC TFH cells for TFH146](separate_countclust_LN_PBMC_TFH_TFH146.Rmd)

Next we perform the analysis for TFH041

[CountClust application separately on LN and PBMC TFH cells for TFH041](separate_countclust_LN_PBMC_TFH_TFH041.Rmd)

Finally the analysis on the Live cells for the TFH095 and MP046

[CountClust application separately on LN and PBMC Live cells for TFH095](separate_countclust_LN_PBMC_Live_TFH095.Rmd)

[CountClust application separately on LN and PBMC Live cells for MP046](separate_countclust_LN_PBMC_Live_MP046.Rmd)
